Further instructions are mentioned in the notebook along with solutions for the errors.<br />

2. Extracting Image of Extracted Ads
3. Extracting Text of scraped Adverts Image
4. Drawing Bounding Box over Text
5. Drawing Bounding Box over Brands Logo(#)
<br />
(#-This is done by using YOLOV5 model custom trained over Flicker Logo 27 dataset.Note the Dataset used for Training Logo detection consisted of only 27 brands logo.Thereby it may not work for all adverts but given access to a better generalised dataset the performance can be improved much better)
